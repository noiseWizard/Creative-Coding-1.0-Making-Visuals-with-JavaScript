        //arrays are like lists and can be identified by the [square brackets] with values separated by commas

        let menu = ["starter", "main", "dessert", "drinks", "sides"];
        //arrays can also be strings. (strings are a 'string' of values)

        //Loops are chunks of code which run over again and again for a finite number of times set.

        //      ...DO THIS
        // }

            console.log(menu[i]);
        //accessing the items of the above menu array, the i here is linked to the i in the first part of the loop, so if the i at the first part changes, it would here as well.
            //can confirm this is how it behaves
        //i'm not sure how Js knows to cycle through each part, but maybe that's part of the syntax for this kind of loop?

        }

        for (let i = 0; i < menu.length; i++) {
            //in the above for loop, the loop stopped at four because of the i < 4, in this version the loop will continue for however long the menu array is
            console.log(menu[i]);
        }

        //loops are not for just reading arrays, loops can also write to arrays
        let years = [];//sets years to be an empty array

        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            years.push(2040 + i);//.push tells the loop to add numbers to a previous array
        }

        console.log(years);
