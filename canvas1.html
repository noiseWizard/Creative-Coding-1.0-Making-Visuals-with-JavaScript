            let canvasVar = document.querySelector("canvas");
            //setting the variable canvas to an expression
            //[document] part refers to Js object which is this html document
            //[.] indicates we want to select something part of that object, in this case a function called querySelector, in this case, selecting an element from the document, being the canvas tag
            //additional notes and thoughts:
            //- could querySelectorById be used if <canvas> had an ID?
            //- the video also said the variable should be set to 'canvas' because it's easier but I feel weird about having a variable defined as the same name as a element tag. that is a me problem likely. I've set it to canvasVar (sorry) for now so I can understand when I'm calling the element compared to the Js var

            let context = canvasVar.getContext('2d');

            context.fillStyle = "blue";
            //this sets the rectangle fill to blue
            context.fillRect(100, 100, 400, 400);
            //the size of the canvas is currently 600
            //the first two 100 are saying "move 100 pixels to the right, 100 pixels down"
            //second two 400, 400 are saying "draw a rectangle 400 pixels across, and then 400 pixels down"
            //the fillRect is actually doing three things:
            //1. creating a new shape
            //2. drawing a rectangle
            //3. filling it with colour

            //if i wanted the outline of a rectangle then I'd need to write more explicit instructions
            context.beginPath
            //telling context I am drawing a new shape
