                  //setting the variable canvas to an expression
                  //[document] part refers to Js object which is this html document
                  //[.] indicates we want to select something part of that object, in this case a function called querySelector, in this case, selecting an element from the document, being the canvas tag
                  //additional notes and thoughts:
                  //- the video also said the variable should be set to 'canvas' because it's easier but I feel weird about having a variable defined as the same name as a element tag. that is a me problem likely. I've set it to canvasVar (sorry) for now so I can understand when I'm calling the element compared to the Js var
                  //this above code was part of the original video, because I wanted to keep my shapes easy to see, I have created a version grabbing by element ID

            let canvasVar = document.getElementById("blueSquare");

            let context = canvasVar.getContext('2d');

            context.fillStyle = "blue";
            //this sets the rectangle fill to blue
            context.fillRect(100, 100, 400, 400);
            //the size of the canvas is currently 600
            //the first two 100 are saying "move 100 pixels to the right, 100 pixels down"
            //second two 400, 400 are saying "draw a rectangle 400 pixels across, and then 400 pixels down"
            //the fillRect is actually doing three things:
            //1. creating a new shape
            //2. drawing a rectangle
            //3. filling it with colour

            context.lineWidth = 4;
            //this ^ was explained after the below section and creates a thicker black line around the box
            //if i wanted the outline of a rectangle then I'd need to write more explicit instructions
            context.beginPath();
            //telling context I am drawing a new shape
            context.rect(100, 100, 400, 400)
            //telling context the where to draw the shape, inlcuding it's size (same as above)
            context.stroke();
            //says to make it an outline
            //context.fill();
            //I think this one would make it filled? it's not completed code though
            //this makes a very faint outline around the shape
            context.lineWidth = 4;

            //using w3 schools canvas page is useful. apparently.
